/**
 * Payroll. The dashboard only, and deliberately nowhere else.
 *
 * There is no till-facing endpoint in this file and no downlink for any of it.
 * What a person earns is between them and the owner; a manager standing at a
 * drawer has no business seeing a colleague's salary, and the surest way to
 * guarantee that is for the figure never to reach the machine they are
 * standing at. That is a property of where the data lives, not a permission
 * somebody can misconfigure later.
 *
 * Two ideas hold the rest together.
 *
 * **The roster is not the staff list.** A rider, a cook and a cleaner draw a
 * wage and never touch the POS; a till account is a credential, not a person on
 * the payroll. So `employees` is its own roster, and the rows that are both
 * things are linked by `staff_local_id`. Anybody with a till account is added
 * to the roster automatically the first time payroll is opened, so the owner
 * never has to type in somebody the system already knows about.
 *
 * **A month's figures are copied, not referenced.** Each payslip carries its
 * own `base_salary` rather than reading through to the employee record, so
 * giving somebody a raise in March does not silently rewrite what they were
 * paid in January. This is the same instinct as stamping an order with its
 * branch at write time.
