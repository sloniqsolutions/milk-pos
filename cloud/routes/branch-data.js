/**
 * Branch-owned data, read-only.
 *
 * Expenses, shifts, staff and stock all belong to the branch that records them.
 * The dashboard shows them; it does not change them, and the response shapes
 * deliberately match the till's own API so the POS screens can be reused
 * unaltered.
 *
 * **Why read-only, rather than an oversight.** There is no downlink for these.
 * Sales travel up; the only thing that comes down is the menu, and that works
 * precisely because the cloud is its single writer. A stock count edited in two
 * places at once has no correct resolution, and a PIN changed on the dashboard
 * could not reach a till that is offline — which is exactly when someone would
 * want to change it. Better an honest "recorded at the branch" than a button
 * that appears to work and silently does nothing.
 *
 * Every figure here is derived from what the tills have actually delivered, so
 * it is only as current as the last successful sync. `/api/branches/completeness`
 * is what tells the dashboard how far behind that is.
