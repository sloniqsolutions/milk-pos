/**
 * Reporting — the cloud's copy.
 *
 * Ported from `backend/routes/reports.js`. It is kept as textually close to the
 * till's copy as the dialect allows, because when the till's reporting changes
 * this has to change with it, and a readable diff is what makes that possible.
 *
 * **This is a Postgres translation, not a copy.** The earlier SQLite cloud let
 * the file across untouched; Supabase does not. Every difference below is a
 * place where a mistake would produce a query that still runs and quietly
 * returns a different number — which is why the port is guarded by a test that
 * compares all ten endpoints against the till's output field by field, rather
 * than by reading.
 *
 * What had to change, beyond `?` placeholders (handled mechanically by `toPg`
 * in db/pg.js):
 *
 *   - `DATE(x)` -> `x::date`. Timestamps are stored as the till's own local
 *     wall-clock text, so casting compares exactly what the shop recorded.
 *   - `strftime(...)` -> `to_char(...)` / `EXTRACT(...)`. No equivalent exists.
 *   - `GROUP_CONCAT` -> `STRING_AGG`.
 *   - **Every aggregate is cast.** `pg` returns `bigint` and `numeric` as
 *     strings to avoid precision loss, so an uncast `COUNT(*)` arrives as "32"
 *     and reaches the dashboard as a string.
 *   - **Dates are formatted, not cast, in SELECT lists.** `x::date` returns a
 *     JS Date that JSON-encodes as a full ISO timestamp, so an evening sale on
 *     the 7th would come back as the 6th.
 *   - Postgres requires SELECT and GROUP BY to agree; SQLite did not.
 *
 * And three differences from the till that are about role rather than dialect,
 * each marked CLOUD: below — scoping, the stored `order_items.category`, and
 * reporting the till's own `local_id` as the order number.
