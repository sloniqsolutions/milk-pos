# Pure Milk POS cloud

The API behind the admin dashboard at `milkpos.virtiqo.com`. It ingests each
branch's live status and sales, and serves both-branch reporting.

Two kinds of caller, with two entirely separate credentials:

| Caller | Credential | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| A till | per-branch API key (`Authorization: Bearer …`) | pushes only |
| The owner | httpOnly session cookie | reads only |

A till can never read another branch's data, and the branch is taken from the
key alone — a `branch_id` in a request body is ignored.

## Running locally

```
npm install
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:...@db.<project>.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
npm start                 # http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

`DATABASE_URL` comes from Supabase: *Project Settings -> Database -> Connection
string -> URI*. The schema is created on first run and is idempotent, so a
deploy is just a restart.

The server refuses to start if it cannot reach the database. That is
deliberate: one that answered requests against an unreachable database would
report an empty shop, which reads exactly like a shop that sold nothing.

## Provisioning

Pure Milk POS is a single shop, single till — unlike the multi-branch system
this cloud was originally built for, `backend/db/database.js` has no
`branches` table of its own to match against. There is exactly one branch
here, by convention id `1`, standing in for this one shop rather than
distinguishing between several.

```
node scripts/provision.js branch 1 "Pure Milk"
node scripts/provision.js owner owner@puremilk.example "a long password" "Shop Owner"
node scripts/provision.js list
```

If a second till is ever added later — a second counter, a delivery branch —
give it the next id (`2`, `3`, ...) and everything here (the dashboard's
branch filter, the Live tab's grid) already supports it; nothing has to
change to grow into that.

Each branch command prints a `cloud-sync.json` ready to drop into that till's
Electron userData folder, beside `pos_database.db`.

**The key is printed once.** Only its SHA-256 hash is stored, so it cannot be
recovered — `provision.js rekey <id>` issues a new one and invalidates the old
one immediately.

## Deploying on the Virtualmin server

The Node process listens on loopback only; Apache/nginx terminates TLS and
proxies to it. This process never faces the internet directly.

1. **Create the sub-server.** Virtualmin → *Create Virtual Server* →
   `milkpos.virtiqo.com` as a sub-server of `virtiqo.com`. `virtiqo.com` itself is
   untouched.
2. **Deploy the code** somewhere outside the web root, e.g.
   `/home/virtiqo/apps/milkpos-cloud`, then `npm ci --omit=dev`.
3. **Reverse proxy.** Virtualmin → *Web Configuration → Proxying* → proxy `/`
   to `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.
4. **systemd unit** so it survives reboots and crashes
   (`/etc/systemd/system/milkpos-cloud.service`):

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Pure Milk POS cloud API
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=virtiqo
   WorkingDirectory=/home/virtiqo/apps/milkpos-cloud
   Environment=NODE_ENV=production
   Environment=TZ=Asia/Karachi
   Environment=PORT=4000
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/node server.js
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   `systemctl enable --now milkpos-cloud`
5. **HTTPS.** Virtualmin → *Manage SSL Certificate → Let's Encrypt*. Free and
   self-renewing. Non-negotiable: this is the shop's whole trading history
   leaving the building.

### Two things to check on the server first

- **Free disk.** `node_modules` alone is ~150–300 MB, and the database grows for
  years. A 1 GiB quota is not enough.
- **The data directory must be on a local disk, not network storage.** SQLite's
  file locking is unreliable over NFS. Normally a non-issue on a VPS; worth one
  look before committing.

Two environment variables are load-bearing:

- **`NODE_ENV=production`** is what makes the session cookie `Secure`. Without
  it, sessions travel unencrypted.
- **`TZ=Asia/Karachi`** must match the shop. The tills write every timestamp in
  their own local wall-clock time, and the reports group by calendar day, so a
  server left on UTC would file the first five hours of every trading day under
  the day before — silently, and only for the early morning, which is exactly
  the kind of discrepancy nobody notices until the month does not add up.

## Supabase, and what it costs

Supabase is Postgres, and the tills are SQLite. That difference is the single
largest source of risk in this codebase.

`routes/reports.js` is ~600 lines translated from `backend/routes/reports.js`.
Every `strftime`, `DATE()` and `GROUP_CONCAT` had to change, and the danger is
not a crash: it is a query that still runs and quietly returns a different
number. Four traps, all of which bit during the port:

1. **`pg` returns `bigint` and `numeric` as strings**, to avoid silent precision
   loss. An uncast `COUNT(*)` arrives as `"32"` and reaches the dashboard as a
   string. Every aggregate is therefore cast in SQL.
2. **`x::date` returns a JS `Date`**, which JSON-encodes as a full ISO
   timestamp — so an evening sale on the 7th comes back as the 6th. Dates in
   SELECT lists are formatted with `to_char`, not cast.
3. **Postgres requires SELECT and GROUP BY to agree**; SQLite did not.
4. **Timestamps are stored as text.** The tills write local wall-clock time with
   no zone; `timestamptz` would make Postgres attach the *server's* zone, so the
   same sale would read differently depending on where the server ran.
5. **Postgres requires SELECT and GROUP BY to agree**, and matches expressions
   textually — so adding a cast to an aliased column silently invalidates every
   other column derived from it.
6. **Floats are truncated to 15 digits on the wire** unless `extra_float_digits`
   is raised. Set on every connection.

Also worth knowing operationally: Supabase's pooler keeps a server connection
alive after this process dies, so a crash mid-transaction leaves it *idle in
transaction*, holding locks indefinitely, and the next deploy blocks on writes
for no visible reason. `db/pg.js` sets `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` on
every connection so those are reaped.

The guard against all of this is `test/verify-against-till.js`, which syncs a
till's history up and checks all eleven report endpoints against the till's own
output field by field:

```
cd backend
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." node scripts/run-script.js ../cloud/test/verify-against-till.js
```

Run it after **any** change to either reporting file.

**It TRUNCATEs the cloud database.** So do `test/menu-downlink.js`. Both refuse
to run against a database that holds orders or a menu unless you also set
`MILKPOS_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1` — a README warning was not enough, as proved by
running the menu test against the live project and leaving every item retired.
`test/dashboard-endpoints.js` and `test/dashboard-renders.js` are read-only and
safe anywhere. It runs
through `backend/scripts/run-script.js` because the till half needs Electron's
Node, whose ABI matches better-sqlite3; the cloud half runs as a child process
on plain Node, exactly as the two run in production.

What Supabase buys in return: managed backups, no disk to run out of, no
question about network storage, and a console for looking at the data.

**A number of these tests (`disaster-recovery.js`, `staff-downlink.js`,
`customers-and-orders.js`, `payroll.js`, `guard.js`) create their own
disposable branch — id 9007, 9008, or similar — precisely so their writes
land somewhere harmless instead of on real trading data. That isolation no
longer holds.** `middleware/branch-auth.js` now authenticates every till with
one fixed `TILL_API_KEY` and always resolves `req.branch` to id 1 — there is
only the one branch this product will ever have — so any request these tests
make, whatever fake branch id they thought they were writing to, actually
lands on branch 1. Do not run them against a database that holds real data
until they are rewritten for the fixed-key model.

## The menu

The cloud owns the menu outright, and it is the only thing that travels *down*
to the tills. That works because there is exactly one writer: the owner edits on
the dashboard, and a paired till refuses local menu edits rather than accepting
one that would silently vanish at the next snapshot.

Import the shop's current menu once, so both sides start identical:

```
DATABASE_URL=... node scripts/import-menu.js
```

Thereafter every edit moves `menu_version`. Tills read that integer from their
heartbeat response — a few bytes they were already receiving — and download the
whole snapshot only when it moves. Whole snapshots, never diffs: a snapshot
either applies or it does not, and missing three is the same as missing one.

Verify the whole path with:

```
cd backend
DATABASE_URL=... DASH_EMAIL=... DASH_PASSWORD=...   node scripts/run-script.js ../cloud/test/menu-downlink.js
```

## The dashboard

The React app lives in `dashboard/`. In production this process serves its
build, so the UI and the API share one origin — which is what lets the session
cookie be a plain `SameSite=Lax` httpOnly cookie with no CORS to negotiate.

```
cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build    # then start the cloud
```

In development run them apart; Vite proxies `/api` across:

```
cd cloud     && npm start      # 127.0.0.1:4000
cd dashboard && npm run dev    # 127.0.0.1:5174
```

Override the build location with `MILKPOS_DASHBOARD_DIST` if the two are deployed
separately. If no build is present the API still runs.

## Layout

```
db/pg.js                connection pool; `?` -> `$n` conversion; transactions
db/schema.js            the Postgres schema, applied idempotently on boot
db/keys.js              branch key generation, hashing, constant-time compare
middleware/branch-auth.js   Bearer branch key -> req.branch
middleware/session.js       httpOnly cookie -> req.user; sessions on disk
routes/auth.js          owner login / logout / me, rate limited
routes/ping.js          till pairing check; returns branch identity and clock skew
routes/live.js          heartbeat ingest (branch key) + live read (session)
routes/ingest.js        sales batches, idempotent on (branch_id, local_id)
routes/reports.js       ported from backend/routes/reports.js, near-verbatim
routes/branches.js      branch list, and how complete each branch's data is
scripts/provision.js    create branches and the owner account
