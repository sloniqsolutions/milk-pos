/**
 * Reading configuration from a .env file.
 *
 * The cloud needs a database URL before it can do anything, and until now that
 * had to be exported into the shell first. In PowerShell an `$env:` variable
 * lives only as long as that window, so every new terminal started without it
 * and the server refused to boot — a papercut that showed up again on every
 * restart, and would show up on the server every time somebody logged in to
 * check something.
 *
 * Written here rather than pulled in as a dependency. It is thirty lines, it
 * has to run before anything else in the process, and a deploy that needs
 * `npm install` to have succeeded before it can even read its own
 * configuration is a worse failure than the one it replaces.
 *
 * **Existing environment variables always win.** A value already exported —
 * by systemd, by a container, by somebody debugging in a terminal — is never
 * overwritten by the file. That keeps the file a convenience for development
 * and a default in production, rather than something that silently overrides
 * the deliberate choice somebody just made.
 *
 * The file holds a live database credential, so it must never be committed.
 * `.env` is in cloud/.gitignore; see .env.example for the shape.
